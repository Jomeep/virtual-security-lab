## Enterprise Network Security Lab

A small-scale virtual enterprise network built with VirtualBox and OPNsense to demonstrate practical skills in network segmentation, firewall policy design, traffic control, security monitoring, and defensive security engineering.

**Project status:** Work in progress  

**Current focus:** Network architecture, segmentation, DHCP, and firewall policy implementation.

____
## Overview

This project simulates a segmented enterprise network in a virtualized environment. OPNsense acts as the central firewall and routing platform, controlling communication between network segments and providing a foundation for additional security monitoring and detection capabilities.

The lab is being developed as a hands-on project to document the design, implementations, testing, and on-going improvements of a security-focussed network.

____
## Objectives

- Design and implement a segmented enterprise-style network.
- Apply default-deny and least-privilege firewall policies.
- Control and document permitted traffic between network segments.
- Validate network isolation and authorized connectivity.
- Implement centralized logging and SIEM integration.
- Explore network intrusion detection and prevention.
- Develop repeatable security validation and compliance checks.
- Maintain technical documentation and evidence of implementation and testing.

## Lab Architecture

The current environment contains the following logical network segments:

| **Segment** | **Intended Purpose**                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| LAN         | Lab administration and infrastructure access |
| Users       | User endpoints and client systems            |
| Servers     | Server workloads and services                |
| Management  | Admin access to managed infrastructure       |
| Guests      | Guest devices with restricted network access |

Each segment is implemented using a VirtualBox internal network adapter and a corresponding OPNsense interface. DHCP scopes are configured individually for the segments.

See [Network Architecture](Docs/Architecture/Network%20Architecture.md) for the topology, IP addressing, trust boundaries, and traffic-flow documentation.

## Security Design Principles

The lab is being developed with the following principles in mind:

- **Network segmentation:** Separate systems according to their intended roles.
- **Default deny:** Deny traffic that is not explicitly authorised by policy.
- **Least privilege:** Permit only the network access required for documented use cases.
- **Restricted administration:** Limit administrative access to designated management paths.
- **Verification:** Test both permitted and prohibited traffic flows.
- **Monitoring:** Develop visibility into network activity and security-relevant events.
- **Documentation:** Record design decisions, configuration changes, test results, and known limitations.
